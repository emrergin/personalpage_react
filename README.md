I undertook this project thanks to the tip of my tutor.

It replicates my [personal page](https://github.com/emrergin/personalpage) with React, adding Router on top of it.

### What I learned

- This is not exactly my first project with React, but it is the first complete one.
- This is the first project that I used with Routers.
- This is the first project I used Netlify as a hosting provider.
- This is the first project that I had to use a Wrapper function for a component.
