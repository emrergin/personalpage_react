I undertook this project thanks to the tip of my mentor.

It replicates my [personal page](https://github.com/emrergin/personalpage) with React, adding Router and serverless functions on top of it.

Routing animations is from [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-animation-working-fix-forked-2t1hmb?file=/src/styles.css:1249-2217)

### What I learned

- This is not exactly my first project with **React**, but it is the first complete one.
- This is the first project that I used **Routers** with.
- This is the first project I used **Netlify** as a hosting provider.
- This is the first project that I had to use a Wrapper function for a component.
- This is my first experience with so-called **serverless functions**.
- This is the first time I am using **useContext** and **useReducer** in one of my projects. I learned about them in [Part 9](https://github.com/emrergin/fullstackopen/tree/main/part9) before.
